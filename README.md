# Wine-Quality-Prediction

## Project Overview:
The focus of the Wine Quality Prediction project is to develop machine learning models that can accurately predict the quality of wines based on their physicochemical properties. The dataset used in this project contains 1143 observations and 13 features, with 12 independent variables representing various physicochemical attributes and one target variable, "good-quality," indicating whether a wine is of good quality or not.

## About the Dataset:
The dataset comprises a comprehensive collection of physicochemical measurements, including fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol content. These attributes provide insights into the chemical composition and characteristics of the wines, which are instrumental in determining their quality. Additionally, the dataset includes a binary target variable, "good-quality," which categorizes wines based on predefined quality thresholds.

## Data Dictionary:
The dataset includes the following columns:
|Column|Description|
|---|---|
|Unnamed: 0|Index|
|fixed acidity|Fixed acidity level of the wine|
|volatile acidity|Volatile acidity level of the wine|
|citric acid|Citric acid content of the wine|
|residual sugar|Residual sugar content of the wine|
|chlorides|Chloride content of the wine|
|free sulfur dioxide|Free sulfur dioxide content of the wine|
|total sulfur dioxide|Total sulfur dioxide content of the wine|
|density|Density of the wine|
|pH|pH level of the wine|
|sulphates|Sulphate content of the wine|
|alcohol|Alcohol content of the wine|
|good-quality|Quality label indicating whether the wine is of good quality (1) or not (0)|

By leveraging this dataset, the project aims to develop predictive models that can effectively classify wines into good quality and poor quality categories based on their physicochemical properties. The insights gained from this analysis can help winemakers optimize production processes, improve quality control measures, and ultimately enhance the overall quality of wines produced.
